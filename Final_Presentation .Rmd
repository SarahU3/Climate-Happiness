This project aims to investigate the **relationship between happiness levels and emissions** across German federal states (Bundeslaender) and among individuals from 1990 to 2012. 

More specifically, this project explores whether the state level emissions, as well as some personal characteristics, affect life satisfaction of German citizens. 


## <img src="Data//HertieCollaborativeDataLogo_v1.png" height="40px" width="20px" /> Hypotheses
The hypotheses state:

- **H1**: Bundeslaender with higher emissions inversely affect reported levels of life satisfaction.

- **H2**: Reported individual concerns with the environment are, likewise, negatively reflected in the
life satisfaction.

**Model 1** combines these two hypotheses: 

<div class="black">
$$satis = \beta_0 − \beta_1*Emissions + \beta_2*EnvironConcerns + uj + ri$$
</div>   

<br>

**Model 2** provides a multilevel analysis which examines individual variation within and across groups, as well as permits non-independence of individual factors from the group level variables:
_need to fix model 2 equation_
<div class="black">
$$satis = \beta_0 − \beta_1*Emissions + \beta_2*EnvironConcerns + uj + ri$$
</div>

## <img src="Data//HertieCollaborativeDataLogo_v1.png" height="40px" width="20px" /> Data

- The **individual-level data** is provided by:
    + The German Socio-Economic Panel Data GSOEP conducted by the German Institute for Economic Research DIW

- The **state-level data** is gathered from four web-based sources:
    + State Initiative for Core Indicators LIKI
    + Statista.com
    + Environmental-Economic Accounting of the Bundeslaender UGRdL
    + Agency for Renewable Agency of North Rhine-Westphalia AfEE
