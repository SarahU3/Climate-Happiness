## Introduction and Motivation 
Climate change is undoubtedly a global problem, but this fact means it is also, in a way, a classic tragedy of the commons. No country wants to put itself at an economic disadvantage by restricting the use of cheap fossil fuels so all continue to emit, deteriorating the "commons" of the Earth's protective atmosphere. This can make it difficult to get citizens to identify with the problem and take responsibility; people will more likely act when something affects them individually. In this paper we want to explore this aspect: how much do people feel, consciously or unconsciously, the effects of green house gas emissions? More specifically, do emissions affect their reported health, well-being, or life satisfaction?  

### Theoretical framework

Since the conventional theory on life satisfaction has largely been focusing on economic (income, unemployment, inflation) and social (health, demographics, education) determinants, an environmental component is missing from the standard theoretical framework [@Sekulova2013 p.18]. Therefore, the theoretical basis of the main hypothesis builds on both climate and subjective well-being literature. 

In light with the rising pressure of climate change, the mankind has been facing twin challenges of expanding economic and development opportunities for the fast growing population, while also staying within the boundaries of the environmental constraints. During the onset of the climate discourse in the 1990s and 2000s, the global community labeled the twin challenges as the notion of "sustainable development" [@Jakob2014]. Recently, the issue of reconciling development with natural resources adopted a fresh theoretical notion of "green growth", advocated by the major international organizations (World Bank, United National Environmental Protection, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) (Ibid). The strong green growth proponents argue that stringent environmental policies would have positive impact on economic growth even in the short-term, while their more moderate counterparts emphasize that the sound climate actions are necessary to undetake in order to preserve the world for the future generations, but also avoid devastating changes in the present world (Ibid). 

Although the green growth theory does not explicitly juxtapose climate economics with the theory of life satisfaction, it recognizes "natural factor as a factor of production and its role in enhancing well-being" and points at the adverse effects of climate change and environmental degradation on the human progress [@OECD2011, p. 20]. The OECD has lately added a group of socio-economic indicators to its scorecard of the green growth strategy in order to link it to the social goals, such as poverty reduction, social inequity and inclusion [@OECD2014, p. 21]. Moreover, the OECD have initiated guidelines for measuring subjective well-being as a proxy of quality of life alongside other social and economic dimensions to have a potential framework for measuring the progress of green growth policies on individual happiness (Ibid). These developments give ground for the main hypothesis of the given research: "greener" performance reflected in lower GHG emissions and weaker environmental concerns will likely increase individual well-being due to the benefits of the green growth approach in the current climate situation. 

Simultaneously, the traditional social outlook on life satisfaction justifies the inclusion of other variables (age, gender, employment, and family status) into the empirical model, as these individual-level characteristics play an inextricable part in one's quality of life and thus should be included as controls in regression analysis to avoid generating biases in the estimations [@Bandura p.13]. Furthermore, these socio-demographic factors may pose as life-changing events, which either potentially can permanently impact life satisfaction (ex.: divorce, unemployment due to acquiry of disability, etc.) (Ibid).


Does higher income lead to more happiness? In 1974 Easterlin showed that, for the
United States, individually self-reported happiness increased with individual income,
although there were rapidly “decreasing happiness returns” to increases in income. The
cross-individual relationship between income and happiness was found to be far from
linear, and essentially flat for high levels of income. Although this is consistent with the
diminishing returns to increases in consumption that are typically assumed for theoretical
utility functions, there is debate on this topic. Thus, Easterlin found clear evidence of a
positive effect of income on happiness at the individual level, in-line with the
assumptions of standard economic theory―but in contrast with the findings of objective
measures of quality of life (Easterlin 1974). However, Easterlin also found in the same
study that aggregate national happiness over time was essentially flat, seemingly
irresponsive to sustained increases in GDP per capita. This finding is often known as the
“Easterlin Paradox,” in that growth in per capita income is not reflected in increasing
happiness.  p. 7
